It's true,\nthere are a LOT of component libraries out there such as MUI, AntD,\nTailwind, and the list continues. These libraries are very mature and\ncan help you build a great looking application without too much work,\nbut they come with a number of drawbacks. Let's dive into why we created\nthis now.\n\n## Design Style Opinions\nLibraries such as MUI look great out of the box, but they are extremely\nopinionated about their design philosophy and that's OK. Those design\nphilosophies can help you build a nice looking application very quickly\nwithout the need for a designer.\n\nThe problem is if you want a more customized design than say just changing\nsome colors, it becomes more of a challenge and the benefits begin to dwindle.\nMost all offer customization ability but those customizations like disabling the\nripple of a material button come at a cost:\n\n- Download bloat (ripples/animations are hard)\n- Internal breaking changes (once you start customizing internal styles which\nalmost always happens)\n- Increased complexity with overrides\n\nReablocks is designed to not have a design out of the box. We plan to offer\nthemes and provide lots of examples of how to make them beautiful but not having\na design is our priority. This lets you avoid all the nasty overrides and focus\non building the product your team needs.\n\n## CSS-IN-JS\nWhen CSS-IN-JS first came out, it was a game changer. It allowed developers the\nability to write runtime CSS which allowed us to break away from the build time\nvariables we had in LESS/SASS. The ability to do calculations on sizes, dynamically\nchange colors for dark themes and provide a nice type-safe API.\n\nCSS has matured so much since then, literally almost everything I listed above and\nmore can be done with native CSS now. By using the native CSS you also get some\nother advantages:\n\n- Better performance\n- Standard language for styling no matter the project\n- Separation of concerns (styles and code belong in different places)\n\nTo this day, almost every React-based component library still uses CSS-IN-JS.\nThere are many die-hard CSS-IN-JS fans out there that could debate this all day long,\nit's almost like debating React vs Angular vs Vue though.\n\nReablocks is designed to use native CSS features such as CSS variables.\nOut of the box, we provide helpers such as our design tokens provider to\nhelp you standardize and provide a convenient way to define those variables\nbut you don't have to use it and under the hood it's just printing out standard CSS.\n\nThe one drawback to this approach is if you have to support really old browsers,\nthen this won't work. If that's the case, this library isn't for you. Once you don't\nhave to support those, please give us a look again though!\n\n## Documentation\nAlmost all of the libraries I mentioned have great documentation and examples.\nThe challenge begins once you start customizing the components. Some of them let\nyou change the colors inline but if you start adding custom CSS styles and such\nall that goes out the window. Outside of that, maintaining legacy documentation\nfor open-source developers is difficult at each version point.\n\nOften times developers will take the examples from the libraries' website and\nbuild out Storybook stories for them so you can have the examples customized to your usage.\n\nRather than build a fancy documentation site, Reablocks' documentation is\nall built inside Storybook. By doing this, all the documentation is in an\neasy to consume and standard format that any consumer can import into\ntheir Storybook. We've even built Storybook story helpers and specific\ndocumentation on how to set it up in your application.\n\nReablocks is the first component library to take a Storybook-first approach.\nThis is a core principle of ours so we are dedicated to making this as smooth as possible.\n\n## Agnostic Framework Pitfalls\nA recent trend in the UI component libraries is to make vanilla JavaScript\ncomponents and then create wrappers for them. As an open-source developer,\nI understand the reasoning, however, it comes with sacrifices.\n\n- Developers are not able to take advantage of native capabilities and instead\nmonkey patch to support the various frameworks. This can result in oddities due\nto multiple scripts accessing the DOM not in sync with each other.\n- The APIs have to make sacrifices, for example, it becomes more difficult to\ndesign APIs that take advantage of some of the awesome React features like JSX inputs.\n- The documentation and examples suffer because it's so much to maintain.\n- Download bloat is increased because you have to handle things that React just\ndoes manually resulting in a larger download size.\n\nReablocks is dedicated to React and we are going to be focusing on it exclusively.\n\n## Animations\nMost of the libraries have their own animation frameworks\nthey use internally (or don't even do animations natively).\nAnimations are not just important for user experience but can provide\nvaluable experiences to see how data changes over time.\n\nThe challenge begins when you need to synchronize animations between\nall the various components. For example, you have a drawer component\nand when it opens you want to animate in the child components. Usually\ndevelopers handle this by doing `setTimeout`` for the duration the drawer\ntakes to open which is bad for a few reasons.\n\nIt's brittle since the timing is based on the ideal system that can animate at that speed\nThis assumes the animations are all linear, good animations are\nspring-based since they feel more natural\n\nReablocks (and all the Reaviz projects for that matter) are all built on [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/).\nFramer Motion is amazing, it performs spring (and linear if you want) based animations\nthat happen at 60 FPS and can synchronize between desperate components.\nIt's a big bet, but Framer-Motion has been out for a while (previously named\nReact-Pose and based on Popmotion) and is supported by Framer, so as far as bets\nare concerned in technology, it's about as good one as you can make.\n\n## Enterprise-focused\nOne unique attribute of this library is that we aren't trying to make a\nlibrary that is everything to everyone. We are focusing on only on\nenterprise web applications and more specifically data-intensive applications.\nYou won't find any hero banners or similar components, instead components like\ndisplaying large numbers, formatting data sizes, and so on.\n\n## Wrap up\nReablocks is built by industry-leading professionals and the lead developer\n[Austin McDaniel](https://github.com/amcdnl) was a former Angular Material team\nmember. The team has built  more than half a dozen component libraries and the project\nis supported by [Good Code](https://goodcode.us).\n\nWe hope you enjoy our hard work, please share with others and let's\nmake the web a better place.\n"],"names":["_createMdxContent","props","_components","_provideComponents","_jsxs","_Fragment","_jsx","Meta","MDXContent","MDXLayout"],"mappings":"miBAIA,SAASA,EAAkBC,EAAO,CAChC,MAAMC,EAAc,OAAO,OAAO,CAChC,GAAI,KACJ,EAAG,IACH,GAAI,KACJ,GAAI,KACJ,GAAI,KACJ,EAAG,GACJ,EAAEC,EAAoB,EAAEF,EAAM,UAAU,EACzC,OAAOG,EAAAA,KAAMC,EAAAA,SAAW,CACtB,SAAU,CAACC,EAAI,IAACC,EAAM,CACpB,MAAO,iCACR,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMD,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,aACJ,SAAU,YACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,UACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,wBACJ,SAAU,uBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,iCACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,4CACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAME,OAAMF,EAAY,GAAI,CAC9B,SAAU,CAAC;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CACpC,SAAU,8CACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,SAAU;AAAA,uBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,SAAU,qCACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,CAAI,CACT,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,yCACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,YACJ,SAAU,WACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,gEACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA,kBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAME,OAAMF,EAAY,GAAI,CAC9B,SAAU,CAAC;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CACpC,SAAU,oBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,SAAU,qDACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,SAAU,qEACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,CAAI,CACT,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA,0DACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,qFACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA,2DACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,gBACJ,SAAU,eACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,+DACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA,4FACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,uDACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA,2FACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,8BACJ,SAAU,6BACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA,+DACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAME,OAAMF,EAAY,GAAI,CAC9B,SAAU,CAAC;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CACpC,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA,mEACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,SAAU;AAAA,uFACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,SAAU,yEACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,SAAU;AAAA,mDACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,CAAI,CACT,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU,oFACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,aACJ,SAAU,YACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,wDACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,8CACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA,0CACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAME,OAAMF,EAAY,EAAG,CAC7B,SAAU,CAAC,4EAA6EI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC1G,KAAM,+BACN,OAAQ,SACR,IAAK,+BACL,SAAU,eACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,qEAA0Y,CAC/Y,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,qBACJ,SAAU,oBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,4DACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,GAAI,CAC7B,GAAI,UACJ,SAAU,SACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAME,OAAMF,EAAY,EAAG,CAC7B,SAAU,CAAC;AAAA,EAAiFI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC9G,KAAM,4BACN,OAAQ,SACR,IAAK,+BACL,SAAU,iBACX,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA;AAAA,kBAAiJI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CACvK,KAAM,sBACN,OAAQ,SACR,IAAK,+BACL,SAAU,WACX,CAAA,EAAG,GAAG,CACR,CAAA,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMI,MAAKJ,EAAY,EAAG,CAC5B,SAAU;AAAA,6BAChB,CAAK,CAAC,CACN,CAAG,CACH,CACA,SAASM,EAAWP,EAAQ,GAAI,CAC9B,KAAM,CAAC,QAASQ,CAAS,EAAI,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAEN,EAAoB,EAAEF,EAAM,UAAU,EACrF,OAAOQ,EAAYH,EAAAA,IAAKG,EAAW,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAER,EAAO,CAC1D,SAAUK,EAAAA,IAAKN,EAAmBC,CAAK,CAC3C,CAAG,CAAC,EAAID,EAAkBC,CAAK,CAC/B"}
